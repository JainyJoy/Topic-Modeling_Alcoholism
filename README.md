# Topic-Modeling_Alcoholism
In this work I have implemented topic modeling on alcoholism related research paers in order to find out the dominant and hidden topics in them. Topic modeling has performed using the Latent Dirichilet Allocation algorithm - a statistical model. Visualization of the model is done using the pyLDAvis.gensim package.

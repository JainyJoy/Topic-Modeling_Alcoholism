the.beginning of recorded history the patterns of alcohol intake.around the world are constantly evolving and alcohol is.ubiquitous today research has contributed substantially to our.understanding of the relation of drinking to specific disorders.and has shown that the relation between alcohol consumption.and health outcomes is complex and multidimensional increases.in the average volume of drinking are predicted for the most.populous regions of the world in southeast asia including india.cultural differences apparently influence the pattern of alcohol.consumption in addition alcohol is linked to categories of.disease whose relative impact on the global burden is predicted.to increase therefore it is appropriate to implement policies.with targeted harm reduction strategies the crucial need from.a public health perspective is for regular means of coordination.whereby prevention of alcoholrelated problems is taken fully.into account in policy decisions about alcohol control and.regulation in the market for alcoholic beverages.natl med j india  .introduction.alcohol and tobacco are important products of the global addictive demand and have experienced a rapid increase in per capita.consumption the fastest growth has been in developing countries.in the asian subcontinent where the per capita pure alcohol.consumption has increased by over  between  and .alcoholic beverages and the problems they engender have been.familiar in human societies since the beginning of recorded.history accompanying the near ubiquity of alcoholic beverages in.human history has been an appreciation of the social and health.problems caused by drinking whether in greece palestine or.china ancient texts speak eloquently of such problems scientific.attention to problems of alcohol consumption has increased during the past  years every major world religion has at least some.strands that counsel abstinence from alcoholic beverages alcohol.is no longer viewed as a threat to all but rather to a small subclass.of alcoholics or in todays technical terms people who are.alcohol dependent alcohol is causally related to more than .medical conditions overall  of the global burden of

global burden.taking into account both recorded and unrecorded consumption.tables i and ii the highest amount of alcohol consumed per.adult resident is in europe especially in russia and its surrounding countries and in the established market economies of western.europe and north america the least amount of alcohol consumed per resident is in the mostly islamic regions of the eastern.mediterranean and in the lesser developed region of southeast.asia dominated by india between the subregion with the highest.estimated consumption level europe c and the subregion with.the

from occasional and ritualistic use to social.use today the common purpose of consuming alcohol is to get.drunk these developments have raised concerns about the health.and the social consequences of excessive drinking.sources of data.measuring alcohol use and alcoholic liver disease in an individual.or a country has several limitations most studies rely on interviews with patients and their families to estimate the amount.frequency and duration of alcohol consumption however patients may not accurately report the quantity of alcohol they.consume and the definition of a standard drink varies from.country to country studies of the incidence and prevalence of.alcoholic liver disease rather than decompensated cirrhosis alone.in the general population are difficult to conduct because patients.with compensated liver disease usually do not seek medical.attention financial constraints among patients suffering from.excessive alcohol use may hamper the ability to obtain routine.healthcare and further delay the diagnosis of alcoholic liver.disease because of this alcoholrelated problems are usually not.detected until hepatic decompensation occurs.the adult per capita

most widely.consumed alcoholic beverage..drinking pattern in india.a limited number of studies have been conducted on smaller.populations in different regions of india studies in northern india.found the year prevalence of alcohol use to be between  and. in southern india the prevalence of current alcohol use.varies between  and  with a higher prevalence among the.lesser educated and the poor sethi and trivedi found alcohol.misuse to be  among the  years age group and .among the  years age group in a rural population in north.india varma et al found  of those  years of age to be.current users of alcohol and  to be ever users of alcohol in.sikkim nearly  of the population  years of age are chronic.alcoholics this figure is very high compared to the national.average relapse rates after deaddiction for alcohol abuse are also.very high the findings of the above studies need to be interpreted with caution because relatively small samples were used.in a study conducted among   middleaged people in a.community in western india gupta et al found current alcohol.use was reported by  and past use by  more than .of the individuals had never used alcohol the prevalence of.current use decreased rather rapidly in the higher age groups from. in the  years age group to  in the  years age.group differences according to the subjects first language were.notable the ever use prevalence was about  or less among.gujarati hindi and urduspeaking persons compared with.over  among kannada malayalam tamil and teluguspeaking persons the prevalence by religion showed even wider.variations the highest prevalence for ever use was among christians  followed closely by buddhists  the lowest.prevalence was among muslims  which can be explained.by the religious teachings of islam the prevalence was high.among illiterates  peaked among those with primary.education  and then declined to  among those with.college education.studies done in the late s and early s found that. of high school students  of university students and. of young nonstudents consumed alcohol during the same.period medical students reported a much higher prevalence of.alcohol use of  studies in the s suggested abstinence rates of  in yearolds.although various epidemiological studies have been done in.specific regions of india whether the findings could be generalized for the entire population is questionable at least in part.because of methodological problems the most consistent finding.in all the studies was that men are the primary consumers of.alcoholic beverages however the percentage of men who had.consumed an alcoholic beverage varied widely among different.regions ranging from  in chennai city in southern india to. in a village in punjab in northwest india conversely the.alcohol consumption rates among women were consistently low. in another study mohan et al reported a prevalence of.alcohol use of  in men and  among women in three.districts of central north and northeast india.interestingly consumption of alcohol among sikkimese women.is very high compared with the national average moreover the.percentage of drinkers among women is higher in rural compared.to urban areas this percentage is higher among those in the age.group of  years each year kerala consumes  l of liquor.per person the highest in india and nearly three times the national.rate a study conducted by one of us in the s among a.population of  in kerala showed that  of the adult.population consumed alcohol unpublished data..vol  no  ..another epidemiological study conducted in the rural areas of.rajasthan showed that although alcohol consumption had become accepted among men it was still infrequent among women.however drinking by women was more accepted in certain castes.particularly on festive occasions such as weddings in general by.the early s alcohol consumption had become an accepted.leisure activity for men who were married and living in small.families husband wife and no more than three children in this.rural area.preference for an alcoholic beverage.a study by bennett et al in bangalore showed that the following.three types of alcoholic beverages were consumed most often. arrack a traditional drink produced both legally and illegally.by distilling fermented molasses raw brown sugar palm wine.rice or palm sugar it has an alcohol content ranging from .to . palm wine another traditional beverage produced from either.the coconut tree or other palm trees has an alcohol content.ranging from  to . imported liquors such as whisky brandy and rum.studies among the rajputs of northwestern india identified.three preferred types of alcoholic beverages. daru a drink distilled from the flowers of the mahwa tree has.an alcohol content ranging from  to . spirit produced from solvents which varies greatly in alcohol.content and at the time of the study was drunk only by.untouchables and members of other lower castes. english alcohol a distilled liquorusually whisky or gin.associated with the british rule.the consumption of alcoholic beverages in india predates.colonization by the british however in contrast to other countries alcohol consumption was not

diverse nation with cultural variations among ethnic.religious and linguistic groups and there are major differences.between the urban and rural areas one cannot accurately characterize the drinking patterns of all indian ethnic and cultural groups.based on the findings from just one of these groups indian.attitudes to drinking include both permissive and abstinent features especially when different population groups are considered.epidemiology.alcohol abuse can be found among all age groups predominantly in men notable ethnic differences observed were in the.prevalence of alcoholrelated liver disease and associated mortality overall consumption or the average volume of alcohol consumption has been the usual measure of exposure linking alcohol.to disease in recent decades the average volume of consumption works as a risk factor mainly through biological and biochemical effects including dependence to produce long term.health consequences although research shows that the average.volume of alcohol consumption is correlated with measures of.acute consequences such as injury and injuryrelated death several studies indicate that the ability to predict these injury measures is improved by taking patterns of drinking into account.there is an exponential relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed and criminal behaviour including drunken driving.and legal arrests the food and agriculture organization fao.of the united nations observed that with increasing marginalization.and alienation excessive alcohol consumption has become widespread among tribal men in madhya pradesh and bihar not only.do the mens incomes decline but they also forcibly use up even the.womens earnings resistance invites domestic violence and.abuse household food security becomes a major casualty.social functioning is also affected by the amount of alcohol.consumed per day gupta et al noted that among the study.subjects the number of people consuming alcohol was lower than.for example in developed countries but the amount of alcohol.consumed by drinkers was high which suggests the risk of serious.public health problems.the volume of consumption as well as the patterns of drinking.especially irregular heavy drinking have been shown to determine.the burden of disease in other words the impact of the.average volume of consumption on mortality or morbidity

disease and disorders of obesity alcohol disorders.are to some extent disorders of developed societies therefore.where countries are on a path to successful economic development there is a need to put in place policies that are able to.counteract the trend toward increased alcohol consumption and.corresponding alcohol related problems although it is important to recognize that alcohol consumption typically increases.with affluence it should be kept in mind that some of the adverse.effects related to drinking are aggravated by poverty for example.malnutrition and infections common among the poor interact with.alcohol in the development of liver disease as a result alcoholrelated mortality is often highest among the poorest in a society.the constitution of india states the state shall endeavor to.bring about prohibition of the consumption of intoxicating drinks.growing awareness of the problem of alcohol consumption in.india has been reflected in several recent policy initiatives.overall there is increasing liberalization in alcohol production.and availability except for a few states which have promulgated.prohibition prohibition was undertaken in some states but it.largely failed to reduce alcoholrelated problems and gave rise to.some additional problems mahal examined the alcohol policy.in some indian states and included a prohibition dummy for.gujarat in

and....unintentional and intentional injury..for all chronic disease categories for which detailed data are available those data show that.women have a higher risk of these conditions than men who have consumed the same.amount of alcohol however the differences are small at lower levels of drinking rehm et.al a the following sections will look at these disease categories individually..individual disease and injury conditions associated with alcohol use.infectious diseases..nihpa author manuscript..although infectious diseases were not included in the whos comparative risk assessments.for alcohol conducted in  rehm et al  and  rehm et al b evidence.has been accumulating that alcohol consumption has a detrimental impact on key infectious.diseases rehm et al a a such as tuberculosis lÃ¶nnroth et al  rehm et al.c infection with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv baliunas et al .shuper et al  and pneumonia samokhvalov et al c in fact recent studies.rehm and parry  rehm et al a found that the overall impact of alcohol.consumption on infectious diseases is substantial especially in subsaharan africa.one of the pathways through which alcohol increases risk for these diseases is via the.immune system which is adversely affected by alcohol consumption especially heavy.drinking rehm et al c romeo et al  as a result although risk for infectious.diseases does not differ greatly for people drinking less than  grams of pure alcohol per.day compared with abstainers this risk increases substantially for those who drink larger.amounts or have been diagnosed with an aud lÃ¶nnroth et al  samokhvalov et al.c in addition alcohol consumption is associated with poorer outcomes from infectious.disease for heavy drinkers by way of social factors thus people with alcohol dependence.often are stigmatized and have a higher chance of becoming unemployed and destitute as a.result they tend to live in more crowded quarters with higher chances for infection and.lower chances of recovery lÃ¶nnroth et al ..nihpa author manuscript..the relationship between alcohol consumption and hiv infection and acquired.immunodeficiency syndrome aids is different from that with other infectious diseases to.become infected with hiv people must exchange body fluids in most cases either by.injecting drugs with a contaminated needle or more commonly in lowincome societies.engaging in unsafe sex thus although significant associations exist between alcohol use.especially heavy drinking and hiv infection via alcohols general effects on the immune.system baliunas et al  kalichman et al  shuper et al   it cannot be.excluded that other variables including personality characteristics psychiatric disorders.and situational factors may be responsible for both risky drinking and unsafe sex shuper et.al  researchers frequently have pointed out that personality characteristics such as a.propensity for risktaking sensationseeking and sexual compulsivity may be involved in.the risk of hiv infection indeed a recent consensus meeting determined that there is not yet.sufficient evidence to conclude that alcohol has a causal impact on hiv infection parry et.al  however it can be argued that experimental studies in which alcohol consumption.led to a greater inclination to engage in unsafe sex indicate that some causal relationship.between alcohol and hiv infection exists eg george et al  norris et al ..alcohol res health author manuscript available in pmc  march ..\\x0crehm..page ..nihpa author manuscript..once a person is infected with hiv alcohol clearly has a detrimental impact on the course.of the disease especially by interfering with effective antiretroviral treatment pandrea et al. a recent metaanalysis found that problem drinkingdefined as meeting the.national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism niaaas criteria for atrisk drinking.or having an audwas associated with being less than half as likely to adhere to.antiretroviral treatment guidelines hendershot et al  because the level of adherence.to the treatment regimen affects treatment success as well as outright survival alcohol.consumption clearly is associated with negative outcomes for people living with hiv and.aids.cancer.recently the monograph working group of the international agency for research on.cancer concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of alcohol in.animals and classified alcoholic beverages as carcinogenic to humans baan et al  in.particular the group confirmed or newly established the causal link between alcohol.consumption and cancer of the oral cavity pharynx larynx esophagus liver colorectum.and female breast for stomach and lung cancer carcinogenicity was judged as possible but.not established for all sites where alcohols causal role in cancer is established there is.evidence of a doseresponse relationship with relative risk rising linearly with an increasing.volume of alcohol consumption corrao et al ..nihpa author manuscript..the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which chronic alcohol consumption leads to.the development of cancers of various organs are not fully understood it has been suggested.that these mechanisms differ by target organ and include variations ie polymorphisms in.genes encoding enzymes responsible for ethanol metabolism eg alcohol dehydrogenase.aldehyde dehydrogenase and cytochrome p e increased estrogen concentrations.and changes in folate metabolism and dna repair boffetta and hashibe  seitz and.becker  in addition the international agency for research on cancer group.concluded that acetaldehydewhich is produced when the body breaks down ie.metabolizes beverage alcohol ie ethanol but also is ingested as a component of alcoholic.beveragesitself is carcinogenic it likely plays an important role in the development of.cancers of the digestive tract especially those of the upper digestive tract lachenmeier et.al  seitz and becker .diabetes..nihpa author manuscript..the relationship between alcohol consumption and diabetes is complex a curvilinear.relationship exists between the average volume of alcohol consumption and the inception of.diabetes baliunas et al that is lower alcohol consumption levels have a protective.effect whereas higher consumption is associated with an increased risk the greatest.protective effect has been found with a consumption of about two standard drinks  grams.of pure alcohol per day and a net detrimental effect has been found starting at about four.standard drinks  to  grams of pure alcohol per day.neuropsychiatric disorders.with respect to neuropsychiatric disorders alcohol consumption has by far the greatest.impact on risk for alcohol dependence however alcohol also has been associated with.basically all mental disorders eg kessler et al  although the causality of these.associations is not clear thus mental disorders may be caused by auds or alcohol use.auds may be caused by other mental disorders or third variables may be causing both.auds and other mental disorders this complex relationship makes it difficult to determine.the fraction of mental disorders actually caused by alcohol consumption see grant et al..alcohol res health author manuscript available in pmc  march ..\\x0crehm..page ..nihpa author manuscript..the relationship between alcohol and epilepsy is much clearer there is substantial evidence.that alcohol consumption can cause unprovoked seizures and researchers have identified.plausible biological pathways that may underlie this relationship samokhvalov et al.a most of the relevant studies found that a high percentage of heavy alcohol users.with epilepsy meet the criteria of alcohol dependence.cardiovascular diseases..nihpa author manuscript..the overall effect of alcohol consumption on the global cardiovascular disease burden is.detrimental see table  cardiovascular disease is a general category that includes several.specific conditions and alcohols impact differs for the different conditions for example.the effect of alcohol consumption on hypertension is almost entirely detrimental with a.doseresponse relationship that shows a linear increase of the relative risk with increasing.consumption taylor et al  a similar doseresponse relationship exists between.alcohol consumption and the incidence of atrial fibrillation samokhvalov et al b on.the other hand for heart disease caused by reduced blood supply to the heart ie ischemic.heart disease the association with alcohol consumption is represented by a jshaped curve.corrao et al  with regular light drinking showing some protective effects irregular.heavy drinking occasions however can nullify any protective effect in a recent systematic.review and metaanalysis comparing the effects of different drinking patterns in people with.an overall consumption of less than  grams of pure alcohol per day roerecke and rehm. found that consumption of  grams of pure alcohol on one occasion at least once a.month eliminated any protective effect of alcohol consumption on mortality the authors.concluded that the cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption disappears.when light to moderate drinking is mixed with irregular heavydrinking occasions these.epidemiological results are consistent with the findings of biological studies thatbased on.alcohols effects on blood lipids and blood clottingalso predict beneficial effects of.regular moderate drinking but detrimental effects of irregular heavy drinking puddey et al. rehm et al .the effects of alcohol consumption on ischemic stroke are similar to those on ischemic.heart disease both in terms of the risk curve and in terms of biological pathways patra et al. rehm et al a on the other hand alcohol consumption mainly has detrimental.effects on the risk for hemorrhagic stroke which are mediated at least in part by alcohols.impact on hypertension..nihpa author manuscript..overall the effects of alcohol consumption on cardiovascular disease are detrimental in all.societies with large proportions of heavydrinking occasions which is true for most societies.globally rehm et al a this conclusion also is supported by ecological analyses or.natural experiments for example studies in lithuania chenet et al  found that.cardiovascular deaths increased on weekends when heavy drinking is more common also.when overall consumption was reduced in the former soviet union a country with a high.proportion of heavydrinking occasions between  and  the death rate from.cardiovascular disease declined indicating that alcohol consumption had an overall.detrimental effect on this disease category leon et al ..atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm involving the two upper chambers ie atria of the heart.a stroke is the disruption of normal blood flow to a brain region in the case of an ischemic stroke this is caused by blockage of a.blood vessel that prevents the blood from reaching neighboring brain areas in the case of a hemorrhagic stroke rupture of a blood.vessel and bleeding into the brain occurs which prevents normal blood supply to other brain regions..alcohol res health author manuscript available in pmc  march ..\\x0crehm..page ..diseases of the liver and pancreas..nihpa author manuscript..alcohol consumption has marked and specific effects on the liver and pancreas as.evidenced by the existence of disease categories such as alcoholic liver disease alcoholic.liver cirrhosis and alcoholinduced acute or chronic pancreatitis for these disease.categories the doseresponse functions for relative risk are close to exponential irving et al. rehm et al b although the risks associated with light to moderate drinking ie.up to  grams of pure alcohol per day are not necessarily different from the risks.associated with abstention thus the incidence of diseases of the liver and pancreas is.associated primarily with heavy drinking.it is important to note that given the same amount of drinking the increase in the risk for.mortality from these diseases is greater than the increase in risk for morbidity especially at.lower levels of consumption this finding suggests that continued alcohol consumption.even in low doses after the onset of liver or pancreas disease increases the risk of severe.consequences.unintentional injuries..nihpa author manuscript..the link between alcohol and almost all kinds of unintentional injuries has long been.established it depends on the blood alcohol concentration bac and shows an exponential.doseresponse relationship taylor et al  alcohol affects psychomotor abilities with a.threshold dose for negative effects generally found at bacs of approximately  to .percent which typically are achieved after consuming two to three drinks in an hour.accordingly injury resulting from alcohols disruption of psychomotor function could occur.in people with bacs at this level eckardt et al  however the epidemiological.literature shows that even at lower bacs injury risk is increased compared with no alcohol.consumption taylor et al .the acute effects of alcohol consumption on injury risk are mediated by how regularly the.individual drinks people who drink less frequently are more likely to be injured or to injure.others at a given bac compared with regular drinkers presumably because of less tolerance.gmel et al  this correlation was demonstrated with respect to traffic injuries in a.reanalysis hurst et al  of a classic study conducted in grand rapids michigan.borkenstein et al  it also is important to realize that even if the absolute risk for.injury may be relatively small for each occasion of moderate drinking defined as drinking.up  grams pure alcohol in one sitting the lifetime risks from such drinking occasions.sums up to a considerable risk for those who often drink at such a level taylor et al .intentional injuries..nihpa author manuscript..alcohol consumption is linked not only to unintentional but also to intentional injury both.average volume of alcohol consumption and the level of drinking before the event have been.shown to affect suicide risk borges and loera  there also is a clear link between.alcohol consumption and aggression including but not limited to homicides rehm et al.b several causal pathways have been identified that play a role in this link including.biological pathways acting via alcohols effect on receptors for the brain signaling.molecules ie neurotransmitters serotonin and aminobutyric acid or via alcohols.effects on cognitive functioning rehm et al b cultural factors that are related to both.differences in drinking patterns and beliefs and expectations

morbidity and mortality in highincome countries rehm et al  moreover at.any given consumption level this risk increase is larger for women than for men niaaa.has translated the epidemiological findings into lowrisk drinking limits of no more than .standard drinks per week for men and  standard drinks per week for women niaaa. these guidelines also specify that to limit the risk of acute consequences daily.consumption should not exceed four standard drinks for men and three for women niaaa...overall global impact of alcohol consumption on burden of disease..nihpa author manuscript..the most recent systematic overview on the effects of alcohol on global burden of disease.was based on data for the year  rehm et al a b see table  the analyses found.that although auds which constitute the major part of the neuropsychiatric disorders listed.in the table clearly are important contributors to global burden of disease they only account.for less than onethird of the overall impact of alcohol consumption almost equally.important are the acute effects of alcohol consumption on the risk of both unintentional and.intentional injury in addition alcohol has a sizable effect on the burden of disease.associated with infectious diseases cancer cardiovascular disease and liver cirrhosis.however alcohol consumption also has beneficial effects on the burden of disease mainly.on diabetes and the ischemic disease subcategory of cardiovascular diseases yet these.effects are by far outweighed by the detrimental consequences of alcohol consumption..effects of alcohol on people other than the drinker.so far the discussion has centered on alcohols effects on health as measured by indicators.that primarily are based on the records of hospitals and health systems reflecting the.information contained in those records most of the effects considered refer to the health of.the drinker however this analytic approach omits two large classes of adverse.consequences of alcohol social harm to the drinker and social and health harms to others.that result from the drinkers alcohol consumption according to the constitution of the.who who  health is a state of complete physical mental and social wellbeing and.not merely the absence of disease or infirmity p  this definition therefore takes into.account not just physical and mental harms but also social harms both for the drinker and.for others..nihpa author manuscript..a few examples of harm to others are included in the analysis of alcohols contribution to.the global burden of disease listed in table  these include perinatal conditions attributable.to the mothers drinking during pregnancy and injuries particularly assault injuries.however the scope of alcoholrelated social harm and of harm to others stretches well.beyond these items thus a recent study in australia laslett et al  identified the.following harms to others associated with drinking...harms identified based on recordsthese included deaths and hospitalizations.eg attributed to traffic injuries because of driving under the influence child.abuse or neglect cases involving a caregivers drinking and domestic and other.assaults and....harms based on survey reportsthese included negative effects on coworkers.household members other relatives and friends strangers and on the community.as a whole..alcohol res health author manuscript available in pmc  march ..\\x0crehm..page ..nihpa author manuscript..these effects were quite prevalent thus the researchers estimated that within  year more.than  deaths were attributed to drinking by others and more than  million australians.or  percent of all adults were negatively affected by a strangers drinking laslett et al..social harm.drinkers also experience a range of social harms because of their own drinking including.family disruption problems at the workplace including unemployment criminal.convictions and financial problems casswell and thamarangsi  klingemann and.gmel  unfortunately assessment of these problems is much less standardized than.assessment of health problems and many of these harms are not reported continuously.socialcost studies provide irregular updates of alcoholattributable consequences in selected.countries for an overview see rehm et al b thavorncharoensap et al  these.studies regularly find that health care costs comprise only a small portion of the overall costs.associated with alcohol use and that most of the alcoholassociated costs are attributable to.productivity losses in total the costs associated with alcohol use seem to amount to  to .percent of the gross domestic product in highincome countries the alcoholassociated costs.in south korea and thailand the only two midincome countries for which similar studies.are available were at about the same level...conclusions.as this review has shown alcohol use is associated with tremendous costs to the drinker.those around him or her and society as a whole these costs result from the increased health.risks both physical and mental associated with alcohol consumption as well as from the.social harms caused by alcohol to reduce alcohols impact on the burden of disease as well.as on other social legal and monetary costs it therefore is imperative to develop effective.interventions that can prevent or delay initiation of drinking among those who do not drink.particularly adolescents and limit consumption to lowrisk drinking levels among those who.do consume alcohol the remaining articles in this journal issue present several such.intervention approaches that are being implemented and evaluated in a variety of settings.andor are targeted at different population subgroups together with alcoholrelated.prevention policies the implementation of specific interventions with proven effectiveness.can help reduce the pain and suffering and the associated costs resulting from excessive.alcohol use.Ã¯alcoholÃ¢s effects on.brain and behavior.edith v

howÃ¢.ever closer consideration shows that.there also was a lack of neurobiology.research in general moreover most.of the techniques critical to modern.neuroscience were not available in. behavioral genetics and elecÃ¢.trophysiological recording from.slices of brain tissue were in their.infancy and other tools eg.recombinant receptors patchÃ¢clamp.recording singleÃ¢channel analysis.microdialysis gene expression meaÃ¢.surement and recombinant inbred.mice that commonly are used.today simply did not exist what.research areas were emerging in.the s and how have they conÃ¢.tributed to the success of alcohol.research over the past  years..and that acetaldehyde is the effecÃ¢.tive agent has a boomerang quality.because it is discarded every few.years only to return later in fact.evidence continues to accumulate.that alcohol consumption can result.in brain acetaldehyde levels that.may be pharmacologically imporÃ¢.tant deng and deitrich .however the role of acetaldehyde.as a precursor of alkaloid condenÃ¢.sation products is less compelling.lee and colleagues  conÃ¢.cluded that alcohol consumption.does not result in production of.salsolinol however initial studies.by other researchers have provided.some evidence that another alkaÃ¢.loid tetrahydropapavroline may.be formed in the brain from.ethanol and has important pharÃ¢.macological propertiesÃ¢bringing.the discussion full circle to davisÃ¢.proposal of  years ago..the role of acetaldehyde.one prescient idea was that the.primary breakdown product of.alcohol acetaldehyde rather than.the alcohol itself ie ethanol.may have a key role in brain changes.produced by chronic alcohol conÃ¢.sumption the observation that.opiates in the poppy plant are proÃ¢.duced in a chemical reaction called.condensation from dopamine and.acetaldehyde led to the hypothesis.that excessive alcohol consumption.might generate sufficient acetaldeÃ¢.hyde in the brain to allow condenÃ¢.sation with biogenic amines.including dopamine serotonin.and norepinephrine to produce.psychoactive alkaloids such as salÃ¢.solinol these ideas first were develÃ¢.oped in a series of articles from the.laboratory of virginia davis includÃ¢.ing articles published in science and.nature davis and walsh .yamanaka et al  the idea.that alcohol is only a Ã¢proÃ¢drugÃ¢....alcoholÃ¢s actions on.neurotransmitters.alcoholÃ¢s actions on synaptic.transmission essentially were.unknown in  and only have.been slowly and sometimes painfully.established during the past decades.one of the first studies showed.that ethanol inhibited the release.of the signaling molecule ie.neurotransmitter acetylcholine.from the cortex phillis and.jhamandas  these studies.subsequently were extended to.show ethanolÃ¢related inhibition of.release of other neurotransmitters.one of the mechanisms responsible.was an inhibition of voltageÃ¢.dependent ion channels harris and.hood  these studies initiated.exploration of ethanolÃ¢s actions on.ion channels which has become.central to the neurobiology of.alcohol one prescient study by.davidoff  found that ethanol..enhanced neurotransmission using.the neurotransmitter Ã®Â³Ã¢aminobutyric.acid gaba in the spinal cord.this was ignored until the midÃ¢.s eg allan and harris .but since then gaba receptors.have emerged as a major target of.ethanolÃ¢s actions and continue to.be an area of intense research.interest kumar et al .another receptor now recognized.as central to alcoholÃ¢s actions is the.nÃ¢methylÃ¢dÃ¢aspartic acid nmda.subtype of glutamate receptors this.receptor forms a channel through the.cell membrane that upon activation.allows the flow of positively charged.ions eg na k or ca into and.out of the cell remarkably the.inhibitory action of alcohol on these.key receptors was not identified until. lovinger et al  another.type of channel affected by alcohol.is known as calciumÃ¢activated potasÃ¢.sium channels these channels now.are known to be very sensitive to.ethanol and important for alcoholÃ¢s.actions in animal models such as.the fruit fly drosophila and round.worm caenorhabditis as well as in.the mammalian nervous system.treistman and martin  this.was first noted by yamamoto and.harris  using biochemical.measurements but further progress.required development of electroÃ¢.physiological techniques to measure.currents from these channels as well.as cloning of the cdnas encoding.a family of channels known as bigÃ¢.conductance k bk channels.ethanolÃ¢s actions on these channels.were not defined until the mid.s eg dopico et al .the neurotransmitter dopamine.now occupies a place of prominence.in the neurobiology of alcoholism.because acute alcohol exposure actiÃ¢.vates dopaminergic reward pathways.and chronic treatment produces a.hypodopaminergic state

mice only much later.eg samson et al  was alcoÃ¢.hol selfÃ¢administration linked to.release of dopamine in the nucleus.accumbens..other research directions.it also is informative to consider ideas.that have not contributed markedly.to current science one research theme.of the s was ethanol interactions.with membrane lipids the rationale.was that ethanol is such a small nonÃ¢.descript molecule that it is unlikely.to have specific binding sites on proÃ¢.teins and is likely to nonspecifically.enter the cell membranes and alter.the physical properties of the lipids.found in these membranes indeed.evidence emerged that ethanol could.disorder brain membranes and that.chronic alcohol treatment resulted in.tolerance to this action chin and.goldstein  this was an exciting.developmentÃ¢a neurochemical.action of alcohol that resulted in.tolerance however rather large conÃ¢.centrations of alcohol were required.to produce small changes in memÃ¢.brane structure moreover it was.difficult perhaps impossible to show.a link between the lipid changes and.changes in the functions of one or.more proteins that could account for.altered neuronal excitability these.considerations lead to a paradigm.shift and the search for alcoholÃ¢.responsive sites on brain proteins.franks and lieb  harris et al. nevertheless emerging eviÃ¢.dence shows a role for lipids in the.regulation of many ion channels and.there still is interest in the possibility..vol  nos  and  ..that alcohol can alter these lipidÃ¢.protein interactions and thus alter.protein function yuan

have consumed the same.amount of alcohol however the differences are small at lower levels of drinking rehm et.al a the following sections will look at these disease categories individually..individual disease and injury conditions associated with alcohol use.infectious diseases..nihpa author manuscript..although infectious diseases were not included in the whoÃ¢s comparative risk assessments.for alcohol conducted in  rehm et al  and  rehm et al b evidence.has been accumulating that alcohol consumption has a detrimental impact on key infectious.diseases rehm et al a a such as tuberculosis lÃ£nnroth et al  rehm et al.c infection with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv baliunas et al .shuper et al  and pneumonia samokhvalov et al c in fact recent studies.rehm and parry  rehm et al a found that the overall impact of alcohol.consumption on infectious diseases is substantial especially in subsaharan africa.one of the pathways through which alcohol increases risk for these diseases is via the.immune system which is adversely affected by alcohol consumption especially heavy.drinking rehm et al c romeo et al  as a result although risk for infectious.diseases does not differ greatly for people drinking less than  grams of pure alcohol per.day compared with abstainers this risk increases substantially for those who drink larger.amounts or have been diagnosed with an aud lÃ£nnroth et al  samokhvalov et al.c in addition alcohol consumption is associated with poorer outcomes from infectious.disease for heavy drinkers by way of social factors thus people with alcohol dependence.often are stigmatized and have a higher chance of becoming unemployed and destitute as a.result they tend to live in more crowded quarters with higher chances for infection and.lower chances of recovery lÃ£nnroth et al ..nihpa author manuscript..the relationship between alcohol consumption and hiv infection and acquired.immunodeficiency syndrome aids is different from that with other infectious diseases to.become infected with hiv people must exchange body fluids in most cases either by.injecting drugs with a contaminated needle or more commonly in lowincome societies.engaging in unsafe sex thus although significant associations exist between alcohol use.especially heavy drinking and hiv infection via alcoholÃ¢s general effects on the immune.system baliunas et al  kalichman et al  shuper et al   it cannot be.excluded that other variables including personality characteristics psychiatric disorders.and situational factors may be responsible for both risky drinking and unsafe sex shuper et.al  researchers frequently have pointed out that personality characteristics such as a.propensity for risktaking sensationseeking and sexual compulsivity may be involved in.the risk of hiv infection indeed a recent consensus meeting determined that there is not yet.sufficient evidence to conclude that alcohol has a causal impact on hiv infection parry et.al  however it can be argued that experimental studies in which alcohol consumption.led to a greater inclination to engage in unsafe sex indicate that some causal relationship.between alcohol and hiv infection exists eg george et al  norris et al ..alcohol res health author manuscript available in pmc  march ..\\x0crehm..page ..nihpa author manuscript..once a

as likely to adhere to.antiretroviral treatment guidelines hendershot et al  because the level of adherence.to the treatment regimen affects treatment success as well as outright survival alcohol.consumption clearly is associated with negative outcomes for people living with hiv and.aids.cancer.recently the monograph working group of the international agency for research on.cancer

newly established the causal link between alcohol.consumption and cancer of the oral cavity pharynx larynx esophagus liver colorectum.and female breast for stomach and lung cancer carcinogenicity was

increasing.volume of alcohol consumption corrao et al ..nihpa author manuscript..the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which chronic alcohol consumption leads to.the development of cancers of various organs are not fully understood it has been suggested.that these mechanisms differ by target organ and include variations ie polymorphisms in.genes encoding enzymes responsible for ethanol metabolism eg alcohol dehydrogenase.aldehyde dehydrogenase and cytochrome p e increased estrogen concentrations.and changes in folate metabolism and dna repair boffetta and hashibe  seitz and.becker  in addition the international agency for research on cancer group.concluded that acetaldehydeÃ¢which is produced when the body breaks down ie.metabolizes beverage alcohol ie ethanol but also is ingested as a component of alcoholic.beveragesÃ¢itself is carcinogenic it likely plays an important role in the development of.cancers of the digestive tract especially those of the upper digestive tract lachenmeier et.al  seitz and becker .diabetes..nihpa author manuscript..the relationship between alcohol consumption and diabetes is complex a curvilinear.relationship exists between the average volume of alcohol consumption and the inception of.diabetes baliunas et al Ã¢that is lower alcohol consumption levels have a protective.effect whereas higher consumption is associated with an increased risk the greatest.protective effect has been found with a consumption of about two standard drinks  grams.of pure alcohol per day and a net detrimental effect has been found starting at about four.standard drinks  to  grams of pure alcohol per day.neuropsychiatric disorders.with respect to neuropsychiatric disorders alcohol consumption has by far the greatest.impact on risk for alcohol dependence however alcohol also has been associated with.basically all mental disorders eg kessler et al  although the causality of these.associations is not clear thus mental disorders may be caused by auds or alcohol use.auds may be caused by other mental disorders or third variables may be causing both.auds and other mental disorders this complex relationship makes it difficult to

dependence.cardiovascular diseases..nihpa author manuscript..the overall effect of alcohol consumption on the global cardiovascular disease burden is.detrimental see table  cardiovascular disease is a general category that includes several.specific conditions and alcoholÃ¢s impact differs for the different conditions for example.the effect of alcohol consumption on hypertension is almost entirely detrimental with a.doseresponse relationship that shows a linear increase of the relative risk with increasing.consumption taylor et al  a similar doseresponse relationship exists between.alcohol consumption and the incidence of atrial fibrillation samokhvalov et al b on.the other hand for heart disease caused by reduced blood supply to the heart ie ischemic.heart disease the association with alcohol consumption is represented by a jshaped curve.corrao et al  with regular light drinking showing some protective effects irregular.heavy drinking occasions however can nullify any protective effect in a recent systematic.review and metaanalysis comparing the effects of different drinking patterns in people with.an overall consumption of less than  grams of pure alcohol per day roerecke and rehm. found that consumption of  grams of pure alcohol on one occasion at least once a.month eliminated any protective effect of alcohol consumption on mortality the authors.concluded that the cardioprotective effect of moderate alcohol consumption disappears.when light to moderate drinking is mixed with irregular heavydrinking occasions these.epidemiological results are consistent with the findings of biological studies thatÃ¢based on.alcoholÃ¢s effects on blood lipids and blood clottingÃ¢also predict beneficial effects of.regular moderate drinking but detrimental effects of irregular heavy drinking puddey et al. rehm et al .the effects of alcohol consumption on ischemic stroke are similar to those on ischemic.heart disease both in terms of the risk curve and in terms of biological pathways patra et al. rehm et al a on the other hand alcohol consumption mainly has detrimental.effects on the risk for hemorrhagic stroke which are mediated at least in part by alcoholÃ¢s.impact on hypertension..nihpa author manuscript..overall the effects of alcohol consumption on cardiovascular disease are detrimental in all.societies with large proportions of heavydrinking occasions which is true for most societies.globally rehm et al a this conclusion also is supported by ecological analyses or.natural experiments for example studies in lithuania chenet et al  found that.cardiovascular deaths increased on weekends when heavy drinking is more common also.when overall consumption was reduced in the former soviet union a country with a high.proportion of heavydrinking occasions between  and  the death rate from.cardiovascular disease declined indicating that alcohol consumption had an overall.detrimental effect on this disease category leon et al ..atrial fibrillation is an abnormal heart rhythm involving the two upper chambers ie atria of the heart.a stroke is the disruption of normal blood flow to a brain region in the case of an ischemic stroke this is caused by blockage of a.blood vessel that prevents the blood from reaching neighboring brain areas in the case of a hemorrhagic stroke rupture of a blood.vessel and bleeding into the brain occurs which prevents normal blood supply to other brain regions..alcohol res health author manuscript available in pmc  march ..\\x0crehm..page ..diseases of the liver and pancreas..nihpa author manuscript..alcohol consumption has marked and specific effects on the liver and pancreas as.evidenced by the existence of disease categories such as alcoholic liver disease alcoholic.liver cirrhosis and alcoholinduced acute or chronic pancreatitis for these disease.categories the doseresponse functions for relative risk are close to exponential irving et al. rehm et al b although the risks associated with light to moderate drinking ie.up to  grams of pure alcohol per day are not necessarily different from the risks.associated with abstention thus the incidence of diseases of the liver and pancreas is.associated primarily with heavy drinking.it is important to note that given the same amount of drinking the increase in the risk for.mortality from these diseases is greater than the increase in risk for morbidity especially at.lower levels of consumption this finding suggests that continued alcohol consumption.even in low doses after the onset of liver or pancreas disease increases the risk of severe.consequences.unintentional injuries..nihpa author manuscript..the link between alcohol and almost all kinds of unintentional injuries has long been.established it depends on the blood alcohol concentration bac and shows an exponential.doseresponse relationship taylor et al  alcohol affects psychomotor abilities with a.threshold dose for negative effects generally found at bacs of

people with bacs at this level eckardt et al  however the epidemiological.literature shows that even at lower bacs injury risk is increased compared with no alcohol.consumption taylor et al .the acute effects of alcohol consumption on injury risk are mediated by how regularly the.individual drinks people who drink less frequently are more likely to be injured or to injure.others at a given bac compared with regular drinkers presumably because of less tolerance.gmel et al  this correlation was demonstrated with respect to traffic injuries in a.reanalysis hurst et al  of a classic study conducted in grand rapids michigan.borkenstein et al  it also is important to realize that even if the absolute risk for.injury may be relatively small for each occasion of moderate drinking defined as drinking.up  grams pure alcohol in one sitting the lifetime risks from such drinking occasions.sums up to a considerable risk for those who often drink at such a level taylor et al .intentional injuries..nihpa author manuscript..alcohol consumption is linked not only to unintentional but also to intentional injury both.average volume of alcohol consumption and the level of drinking before the event have been.shown to affect suicide risk borges and loera  there also is a clear link between.alcohol consumption and aggression including but not limited to homicides rehm et al.b several causal pathways have been identified that play a role in this link including.biological pathways acting via alcoholÃ¢s effect on receptors for the brain signaling.molecules ie neurotransmitters serotonin and Ã®Â³aminobutyric acid or via alcoholÃ¢s.effects on cognitive functioning rehm et al b cultural factors that are related to both.differences in drinking patterns and beliefs and expectations about the effects of alcohol also.influence the relationship between drinking and aggression bushman and cooper .graham  leonard  room and rossow ..alcohol res health author manuscript available in pmc  march ..\\x0crehm..page ..implications of alcoholrelated risks for drinking guidelines.nihpa author manuscript..overall the various risks associated with alcohol use at various levels can be combined to.derive lowrisk drinking guidelines such analyses found that overall any increase in.drinking beyond one standard drink on average per day is associated with an increased net.risk for morbidity and mortality in highincome countries rehm et al  moreover at.any given consumption level this risk increase is larger for women than for men niaaa.has translated the epidemiological findings into lowrisk drinking limits of no more than .standard drinks per week for men and  standard drinks per week for women niaaa. these guidelines also specify that to limit the risk of acute consequences daily.consumption should not exceed four standard drinks for men and three for women niaaa...overall global impact of alcohol consumption on burden of disease..nihpa author manuscript..the most recent systematic overview on the effects of alcohol on global burden of disease.was based on data for the year  rehm et al a b see table  the analyses found.that although auds which constitute the major part of the neuropsychiatric disorders listed.in the table clearly are important contributors to global burden of disease they only account.for less than onethird of the overall impact of alcohol consumption almost equally.important are the acute effects of alcohol consumption on the risk of both unintentional and.intentional injury in addition alcohol has a sizable effect on the burden of disease.associated with infectious diseases cancer cardiovascular disease and liver cirrhosis.however alcohol consumption also has beneficial effects on the burden of disease mainly.on diabetes and the ischemic disease subcategory of cardiovascular diseases yet these.effects are by far outweighed by the detrimental consequences of alcohol consumption..effects of alcohol on people other than the drinker.so far the discussion has centered on alcoholÃ¢s effects on health as measured by indicators.that primarily are based on the records of hospitals and health systems reflecting the.information contained in those records most of the effects considered refer to the health of.the drinker however this analytic approach omits two large classes of adverse.consequences of alcohol social harm to the drinker and social and health harms to others.that result from the drinkerÃ¢s alcohol consumption according to the constitution of the.who who  health is Ã¢a state of complete physical mental and social wellbeing and.not merely the absence of disease or infirmityÃ¢ p  this definition therefore takes into.account not just physical and mental harms but also social harms both for the drinker and.for others..nihpa author manuscript..a few examples of harm to others are included in the analysis of alcoholÃ¢s contribution to.the global burden of disease listed in table  these include perinatal conditions attributable.to the motherÃ¢s drinking during pregnancy and injuries particularly assault injuries.however the scope of alcoholrelated social harm and of harm to others stretches well.beyond these items thus a recent study in australia laslett et al  identified the.following harms to others associated with drinking.Ã¢..harms identified based on recordsÃ¢these included deaths and hospitalizations.eg attributed to traffic injuries because of driving under the influence child.abuse or neglect cases involving a caregiverÃ¢s drinking and domestic and other.assaults and..Ã¢..harms based on survey reportsÃ¢these included negative effects on coworkers.household members other relatives and friends strangers and on the community.as a whole..alcohol res health author manuscript available in pmc  march ..\\x0crehm..page ..nihpa author manuscript..these effects were quite prevalent thus the researchers estimated that within  year more.than  deaths were attributed to drinking by others and more than  million australians.or  percent of all adults were negatively affected by a strangerÃ¢s drinking laslett et al..social harm.drinkers also experience a range of social harms because of their own drinking including.family disruption problems at the workplace including unemployment criminal.convictions and financial problems casswell and thamarangsi  klingemann and.gmel  unfortunately assessment of these problems is much less standardized than.assessment of health problems and many of these harms are not reported continuously.socialcost studies provide irregular updates of alcoholattributable consequences in selected.countries for an overview see rehm et al b thavorncharoensap et al  these.studies regularly find that health care costs comprise only a small portion of the overall costs.associated with alcohol use and that most of the alcoholassociated costs are attributable to.productivity losses in total the costs associated with alcohol use seem to amount to  to .percent of the gross domestic product in highincome countries the alcoholassociated costs.in south korea and thailand the only two midincome countries for which similar studies.are available were at about the same level..nihpa author manuscript..conclusions.as this review has shown alcohol use is associated with tremendous costs to the drinker.those around him or her and society as a whole these costs result from the increased health.risks both physical and mental associated with alcohol consumption as well as from the.social harms caused by alcohol to reduce alcoholÃ¢s impact on the burden of disease as well.as on other social legal and monetary costs it therefore is imperative to develop effective.interventions that can prevent or delay initiation of drinking among those who do not drink.particularly adolescents and limit consumption to lowrisk drinking levels among those who.do consume alcohol the remaining articles in this journal issue present several such.intervention approaches that are being implemented and evaluated in a variety of settings.andor are targeted at different population subgroups together with alcoholrelated.prevention policies the implementation of specific interventions with proven effectiveness.can help reduce the pain and suffering and the associated costs resulting from excessive.alcohol use.'"
